	<h5>Avoid Contact</h5>

	<p>Don’t get me wrong, getting your ex back can be a good thing if you have a good reason to get back together.  But you have to understand that bargaining is also just one of the emotions after a breakup. And getting back together just because you are going through a phase of grieving is not a good decision. In fact, you might end up regretting this decision if the relationship is not right for you. The more time spent talking to said ex the more difficult it becomes to make clear decisions about where to go with the relationship.</p>

<div class="step2">
	<h5>Remember That You're Better Off</h5>
	<img id="pic2" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSbkGdG4fZ0J0yyIfGaVv4yU5_HO6tmQZPELVC7ZBcQA5YyfwUQ5w">
	<p>Focus on the reasons for the breakup and steps for moving forward. Consider all the possible pros and cons of your ex before agreeing to talk. Keep in mind that getting back into a relationship with an ex often will not feel the same as it did before the breakup. If you want to get back together with your ex, consider individual and couple therapy. Bargaining isn’t helpful, so it’s important you get to the root of the problem, if you want to move forward with your relationship.</p>

<div class="step3">
	<h5>Know Your Worth</h5>

	<p>Never be so into a relationship that you lose yourself along the way. Remember that your value does not decrease because of someone elses inability to see your worth. Be strong enough to stand up for yourself and wait for the right new relationship to come along. Set boundaries and standards on the kind of treatment you are willing to accept in future relationships. If you find yourself bargaining, it may be helpful to seek out a therapist that can help you talk through your feelings.  </p>

	<h5>Ex Lover Blocker</h5>
	<p>A Brazilian company made an app in June 2012 that alerts your friends when you try call your ex. If you try to work around the alert, the app publicly shames you on Facebook for trying to reach out to your old flame.

	<h5>Drunk Lock</h5>
	<p>Haven’t deleted your ex’s phone number from your address book or your memory? This app makes you pass a sobriety test (timed math problems) before it allows you to phone your ex, thus blocking those not-so-sober calls you’ll probably regret the next morning.</p>

	<h5>The Ex App</h5>
	<p>The Ex-App blocks you from making outgoing calls, text messages, or emails to your ex. It also tracks the number of consecutive days that you have stopped contacting your ex to help you stay motivated and committed to your new awesome ex-free life.</p>
