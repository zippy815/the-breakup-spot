	<p id="p1">It’s never easy when a marriage or significant relationship ends. Whatever the reason for the split—and whether you wanted it or not—the breakup of a relationship can turn your whole world upside down and trigger all sorts of painful and unsettling feelings. But there are plenty of things you can do to get through this difficult time and move on. You can even learn from the experience and grow into a stronger, wiser person.</p>

<h2>Understanding Your Grief</h2>
<div class="step1">
	<h5>Don't go through it alone.</h5>
	<p>You lost an important relationship in your life – even if it wasn’t healthy – and it’s not easy to just “get over it.” The more valuable the relationship was to you, the more dramatic your grieving process will be. Sharing your feelings with friends and family can help you get through this period. Consider joining a support group where you can talk to others in similar situations. Isolating yourself can raise your stress levels, reduce your concentration, and get in the way of your work, relationships, and overall health. Don’t be afraid to get outside help if you need it. </p>
</div>
<div class="step2">
	<h5>Feel your emotions - Don't avoid them</h5>
	<p>When you strip away a big part of your life, you feel exposed, empty, and vulnerable. You may feel tempted to avoid dealing with the pain of breakup depression. Why? Because it hurts a lot. It’s not easy to allow yourself to experience the waves of grief, anxiety, fear, and other scary emotions. You may feel like you’re going crazy. Allow yourself to work through these feelings by talking to loved ones and taking time for yourself to recover.</p>
</div>
<div class="step3">
	<h5>Understand the reasons for your emotions.</h5>
	<p>Depressed feelings after a breakup can bring back deep-seated memories about being abandoned as a child, says psychologist Dr Susan Quilliam, author of How to Choose a Partner. We are programmed to need human contact and to be affected when human contact is withdrawn. So you’re grieving not only the absence of your boyfriend or husband, you’re also dealing with issues from your childhood. If you have unresolved grief from your past, those emotions will rise up after this breakup.</p>

<h2>Dealing With Feelings of Depression</h2>
<div class="dealing">
	<h5>Listen to your mind and body.</h5>
	<p>Learning how to overcome depression is unique to each woman, which means you need to listen to what your body and spirit is telling you. You may need physical healing in the form of increased self-care (eg, soothing bubble baths, calming acupuncture sessions, a physical checkup from your family doctor). Or, you may need emotional healing from a counselor or psychologist. Determine what recharges and refreshes you. The best way to restore your physical, emotional, and spiritual health is to give your body the rest, nutrition, and exercise it needs.</p>
