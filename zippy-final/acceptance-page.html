<span class="steps">
	<div class="step1">
	<h5>Name Your Triggers</h5>
	<p>Let’s face it, there’ll be meltdowns along the way. All those things that remind you of your ex now bring about a note of sorrow. Grab a pen and a friend, and write down your list of triggers. Then write what you can do to either avoid them. Whatever you do, know what’s going to set you off and have a plan for them.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="step2">
	<h5>Toss It, Sell It Or Burn It</h5>
	<p>Clearing yourself of clutter allows you to move forward. And a little bonfire now and then can be a very cathartic experience. It’s not about revenge or being bitter; it’s about making space for the new.<a href="https://www.neverlikeditanyway.com/ ">NeverLikedItAnyWay.com</a> is a marketplace for the brokenhearted, where you can sell your ex’s gifts and buy the remnants of other relationships.</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="step3">
	<h5>Redecorate Your Space</h5>
	<p>Your surroundings reflect your reality. Changing up some basic things will not only refresh your space, it will refresh your mind. You can do some cheap and easy fixes like changing bedding or moving some furniture around. Or, if you’re feeling game, you can go all out: Paint the walls and refurbish your room.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="step4">
	<h5>Make Over</h5>
	<p>Confidence is everything. It’s the magnetism we put out to the rest of the world and dictates what we draw in. Makeovers sound fickle, but they are actually effective. Chuck or sell the clothes you won’t wear, stalk some Pinterest boards and then hit the shops. This is not about spending your way out of your sorrow (we all know that doesn’t work), it’s about finding bold, signature pieces that restore your inner confidence and glow.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="step5">
	<h5>Write A Wishlist</h5>
	<p>Rather than writing a depressing ‘deal breakers’ list, take this as your chance to write a Wishlist. Write a nice little list of all the positive attributes you want to find in your next love. This “perfect” guy won’t magically appear, but what really matters is that you’ve left yourself open to a new set of attributes; you’ve found a way to learn from the past.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="step6">
	<h5>Exercise</h5>
	<p>Exercise releases endorphins and endorphins make you feel good. You may feel like hibernating after a break-up, but don’t. Grab the boxing gloves, hit the ballet bar, sing it out at spin – whatever you do, make sure you sweat.</p>
