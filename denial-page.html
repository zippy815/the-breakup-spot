	<p class="p1">Denial is the often the first reaction to breakups. Which is why so many of us get back together with our exes only to repeat the same mistakes and breakup again. We deny the reality of the situation. We rationalize our emotions, avoiding the facts. While you may be convinced your separation is only temporary, recognize this may be a defense mechanism. Understand you are not in a position to think rationally. Avoid making big decisions in the days and weeks following your breakup. One of the first steps is looking at reasons the relationship may not have been the best. </p>

	<h3>Open up</h3>
	<p> Start by talking about the relationship with friends and family. The more you talk, the more you will begin to accept the situation for reality. Allow loved ones to provide comfort and doses of reality when needed. Their support will help you begin to dissect aspects of the relationship both good and bad, and come to the realization that the breakup was for a reason.</p>
	<h3>Questions to ask yourself:</h3>
	<ul class="questions">
		<li>Were you truly happy?</li>
		<li>Where did things begin to change?</li>
		<li>Was it a healthy relationship?</li>
		<li>Was the relationship a priority?</li>
		<li>What can you learn from the experience?</li>
	</ul>
